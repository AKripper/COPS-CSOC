# Raft

## Introduction
This is my analysis for *Raft*.
## Writeup

I started a new world and as you can see I have nothing much in this world and my thirst level is going down very fast...Now I save it as it is. This is my game save and I name it `mygame.rgd`. 

### Accessing Save File
I located the game save in the hidden AppData folder. To get here open you search bar and type` %AppData%`. This will direct you to a hidden folder. This is where all the games store their save files. Raft's save file is in the following location `\AppData\LocalLow\Raft\Raft\SavedGames`. 

### Analysing and Identifying
The save file for Raft contains some readable text and some binary text. I used HxD to get the hexdump for this file and started studying the working of this save file.

After some time I started understood the patterns of data in the save files.

Here I can see that the values are wriiten in `Little Endian` format for the quatities, I will be taking the max value is `C8420000` which corresponsd to 100.
- **Hunger**: `C242B95D` => 97.01
- **Thirst**: `BB420B32` => 93.51
- **Health**: `C8420000` => 100
- **Fatigue**: `C8420000` => 100

I also realized that every time there is some text, the binary part always starts with the byte `02` and ends with the byte `04`.

### Editing
#### HxD
I will be using hexedit to edit this save file now that I have understood the pattern.

I will start by making all the values `100`, i.e, `0xC8420000` and see if it reflects in the game.

As you can see I have changed the values of hunger an thirst respectively, now we will be looking into the game to see if it worked.

Clearly it did work. So I was successfully able to change the save file using the hexdump of the file alone, with the help of HxD.

#### Save Editor
Now from some research I found out this amazing tool called [Save Editor](https://www.saveeditonline.com). So I uploaded my save file here and this is what I got.

This is part of the save file...it shows all the player charecteristics like inventory items and their amount and even thirst and hunger.

I will start by increasing my hunger and thirst to 100.

Now saving this file and going into the game my thirst and hunger has indeed increased to 100.

I did the same for inventory items and game it the max number that is 10. And it worked as well.

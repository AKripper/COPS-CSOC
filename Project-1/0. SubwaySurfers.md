# Subway Surfers

## Introduction
This is my analysis for the game *Subway Surfers*. You can find the game folder attached [here](com.kiloo.subwaysurf.zip).

## Writeup
I started by browsing here and there at first, my goal was to find the save file of this game. These are the contents of the `files` directory.

Now going to the `profile` directory we find a lot of `.json` files.

These files most likely contain all the data of individual profiles. Looking at one of the file I found out that the data was encrypted which was quite obvious for keeping it invulnerable from hackers.

I base64 decoded the data string but it gave some gibberish value. The data is likely AES encrypted and for decoding it we will need to find the key and IV(initialization vector) which is not going to be an easy task. So I started browsing the directories where I found this file in the `tower>gamedata>manifest`

These are all the keys to the data present in the files. I tries decrypting them but wasn't successful in doing so. Going forward I browsed the `tower` directory and found out that the `client` directory in it contains all the information about the version of the game.

Checking the latest version it has the following information:

We see the 'secret' and 'gamedata' headers contain some hexadecimal strings. These strings are likely used to decrypt the data for profile objects in the game.


Clearly reversing this game is not an easy job so I will try doing the same for another game.

## Challenge Description
Calculate the following integers:
```
11 ≡ x mod 6
8146798528947 ≡ y mod 17
```
The solution is the smaller of the two integers.

## Writeup
For  `a ≡ b mod c`, it means that  `a` divided by `c` gives the remainder `b`.
[Here](ma1.py) is hte script.

Clearly 4 is the smaller number and thus our flag.

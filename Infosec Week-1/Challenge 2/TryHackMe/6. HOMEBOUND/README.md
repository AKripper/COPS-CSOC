## Background
Based on their tweets, it appears our cybercriminal is indeed heading home as they claimed. Their Twitter account seems to have plenty of photos which should allow us to piece together their route back home. If we follow the trail of breadcrumbs they left behind, we should be able to track their movements from one location to the next back all the way to their final destination. Once we can identify their final stops, we can identify which law enforcement organization we should forward our findings to.

## Questions
1. What airport is closest to the location the attacker shared a photo from prior to getting on their flight?
2. What airport did the attacker have their last layover in?
3. What lake can be seen in the map shared by the attacker as they were on their final flight home?
4. What city does the attacker likely consider "home"?

## Writeup
The Following posts indicate that the attacker was in Bethesda before taking her flight.

Now the nearest Airport to Bethesda is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport which has the 3 digit code DCA.

And finally we can see the city free wifi mentioned in the deep paste mentions 'Hirosaki'.
Thus the attacker likely lives in Hirosaki.

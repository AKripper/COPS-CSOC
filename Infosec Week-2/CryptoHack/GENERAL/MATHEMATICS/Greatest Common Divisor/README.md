## Challenge Description
There are many tools to calculate the GCD of two integers, but for this task we recommend looking up [Euclid's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm).

Try coding it up; it's only a couple of lines. Use `a = 12, b = 8` to test it.

Now calculate `gcd(a,b)` for `a = 66528, b = 52920` and enter it below.

## Writeup
I wrote the [script](ea.py) for gcd of two numbers using Euclidean Algoritm.

## Flag

# Raft

## Introduction
This is my analysis for *Raft*.
## Writeup

I started a new world and as you can see I have nothing much in this world and my thirst level is going down very fast...Now I save it as it is. This is my game save and I name it `mygame.rgd`.

### Accessing Save File
I located the game save in the hidden AppData folder. To get here open you search bar and type` %AppData%`. This will direct you to a hidden folder. This is where all the games store their save files. Raft's save file is in the following location `\AppData\LocalLow\Raft\Raft\SavedGames`. 

### Analysing and Identifying


### Editing
Now from some research I found out this amazing tool called [Save Editor](https://www.saveeditonline.com). So I uploaded my save file here and this is what I got.

This is part of the save file...it shows all the player charecteristics like inventory items and their amount and even thirst and hunger.

I will start by increasing my hunger and thirst to 100.

Now saving this file and going into the game my thirst and hunger has indeed increased to 100.

I did the same for inventory items and game it the max number that is 10. And it worked as well.

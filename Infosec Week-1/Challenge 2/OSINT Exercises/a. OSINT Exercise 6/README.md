## Writeup
Now to verify the image I first searched the image of google, but found nothing relevent. Then I searched the image in [Tineye](https://tineye.com) and found more that 360 such images and many of them are dated before 2020. This indicates that the image does not actually belong to the suicide attack of Pakistan.

## Task briefing
The text below is a partial transcript of a phone call in which you can only read one side of the conversation. Despite the text being completely fabricated for this exercise, the location described is real. Your task is to geolocate where the person was at the time of this fictitious phone call.

## Writeup 
We can see that the person says "My German us handy after all". Now, he wouldn't say that if he was in Germany. We can thus conclude that the person is in a country where German is spoken and the country also has a sea coast as we can see form another conversation the person says that the sea is an hour and a half from his place.

Looking at the map we can see Belgium is the only country which has a sea coast. Now we have to find a city that is 1 and a half hour away from the coast. *Ghent* is a likely the city as it satisfies our conditions.

We see that the person has mentionsed some sort of prayers. So he was likely in a Mosque. And he jokes as if he should have brought swimming shorts likely means that that the carpet in the Mosque is ble in colour.
So we have to find Mosques that have a new carpet which is now blue in colour and is near a river or a canal.

Knowing all this we can narrow down to 2 mosques that have a blue carpet:
- Moskee OKBA IBN NAFI
- Yavuz Sultan Selim masjid Ledeberg


I tried checking the which of these two meet our conditions by checking the train stations near them or any river bodies and so, but couldn't find much. Checking the writeup for this problem I learnt that *Moskee OKBA IBN NAFI* has a social media account that shows that the blue carpet in the image was indeed a new one so this is our final answer.

## Answer
Moskee OKBA IBN NAFI

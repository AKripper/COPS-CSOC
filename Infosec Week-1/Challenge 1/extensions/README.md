## Challenge Description
This is a really weird text file [TXT](flag.txt)? Can you find the flag?

## Writeup

I started by opening the text file and saw the format similar to a PNG file format. So I renamed the file from `flag.txt` to `flag.png` and opened the image file.

This directly gave the flag.
